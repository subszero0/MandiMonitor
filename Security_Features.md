# Security Features - MandiMonitor Bot

*A comprehensive guide to the security measures protecting your data and our system*

---

## 🛡️ Executive Summary

The MandiMonitor bot is built with **enterprise-grade security** from the ground up. We follow **security-by-design** principles, meaning security isn't an afterthought—it's built into every component of our system.

**Our commitment:** Protect your data, maintain system integrity, and ensure reliable service through multiple layers of security controls.

## 🔐 Top 10 Security Features

### 1. **Privacy-by-Design Data Collection** 
**What it means:** We collect the absolute minimum data needed for the bot to work.

**How it protects you:**
- We only store your Telegram user ID (a number, not your name)
- No personal information like phone numbers, real names, or messages
- No tracking of your browsing or personal habits
- You can stop using the bot anytime to cease all data processing

**Technical detail:** Our database stores only pseudonymous identifiers, making it impossible to link data back to your real identity.

### 2. **Encrypted Database Backups**
**What it means:** All our backup copies of data are protected with military-grade encryption.

**How it protects you:**
- Even if backup files are stolen, they're unreadable without the encryption key
- Uses AES-256 encryption (same standard used by banks and governments)
- Encryption keys are stored separately from the encrypted data
- Automatic backup encryption every night

**Technical detail:** GPG symmetric encryption with 32+ character passphrases, rotated quarterly.

### 3. **Zero-Trust Network Security**
**What it means:** Nothing is trusted by default—every connection must be verified.

**How it protects you:**
- All traffic goes through secure tunnels (Cloudflare Tunnel)
- Multiple authentication layers before any system access
- IP address restrictions limit who can even attempt to connect
- No direct internet exposure of our servers

**Technical detail:** JWT authentication with IP-based ACLs, defense-in-depth networking.

### 4. **Container Security Hardening**
**What it means:** Our software runs in isolated, locked-down environments.

**How it protects you:**
- Each service runs in its own "sandbox" with minimal permissions
- Read-only file systems prevent unauthorized changes
- Non-privileged user accounts (not admin/root access)
- Resource limits prevent any single component from consuming all system resources

**Technical detail:** Docker containers with capability drops, rootless execution (UID 1000), tmpfs mounts.

### 5. **Real-Time Security Monitoring**
**What it means:** We watch for threats and problems 24/7 with automated alerts.

**How it protects you:**
- Immediate notifications when something unusual happens
- Multi-channel alerts (email, Slack, PagerDuty) ensure we respond quickly
- Automatic log analysis detects suspicious patterns
- Component-level monitoring identifies issues before they affect users

**Technical detail:** Sentry error tracking, Grafana Loki centralized logging, custom alert rules.

### 6. **Supply Chain Security**
**What it means:** We verify that all software components we use are safe and legitimate.

**How it protects you:**
- Every software library is scanned for known vulnerabilities
- Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) tracks every component
- Automatic updates when security patches are available
- Container images scanned for malware and vulnerabilities

**Technical detail:** pip-audit + Safety for Python deps, Trivy for container scanning, automated SBOM generation.

### 7. **Secure Development Pipeline**
**What it means:** Security checks happen automatically every time we make changes.

**How it protects you:**
- Code must pass security scans before it can go live
- Multiple approval steps prevent malicious or buggy code
- All changes are tracked and can be reversed instantly
- Short-lived authentication tokens (not permanent passwords)

**Technical detail:** GitHub OIDC authentication, mandatory code review, bandit static analysis, branch protection.

### 8. **Infrastructure Hardening**
**What it means:** Our servers are locked down with multiple security layers.

**How it protects you:**
- Firewall blocks all unnecessary network traffic
- Only essential services are running
- SSH access requires key-based authentication (no passwords)
- Automatic security updates and fail2ban protection

**Technical detail:** UFW + iptables rules, minimal attack surface, key-only SSH, automated hardening.

### 9. **Incident Response Planning**
**What it means:** We have detailed procedures for handling security incidents.

**How it protects you:**
- Rapid response to any security issues (documented procedures)
- Automatic evidence preservation during incidents
- Post-incident analysis to prevent future problems
- Clear communication during any security events

**Technical detail:** Structured incident runbook, automated log preservation, severity classification.

### 10. **Responsible Disclosure Program**
**What it means:** We welcome security researchers to help us find and fix problems.

**How it protects you:**
- Security experts worldwide help identify vulnerabilities
- Clear process for reporting security issues
- Fast response times (3 business days acknowledgment)
- Coordinated disclosure protects users during fixes

**Technical detail:** security@mandimonitor.app contact, defined SLA timelines, hall of fame recognition.

## 🔍 Security Architecture Overview

### **Defense in Depth Strategy**
We use multiple layers of security, so if one layer fails, others still protect you:

```
🌐 Internet Traffic
    ↓
🛡️ Cloudflare Security (DDoS protection, Web filtering)
    ↓
🔒 Zero-Trust Tunnel (JWT authentication, IP restrictions)
    ↓
🧱 Host Firewall (UFW/iptables - only ports 22, 443)
    ↓
📦 Container Security (Rootless, read-only, capability drops)
    ↓
🏛️ Application Security (Input validation, output encoding)
    ↓
💾 Database Security (Encrypted backups, minimal data)
```

### **Trust Boundaries**
- **Public Internet** → **Cloudflare Edge** → **Secure Tunnel** → **Hardened Host** → **Isolated Container** → **Application** → **Database**
- Each boundary has its own security controls and monitoring

## 📊 Security Monitoring & Alerting

### **What We Monitor 24/7:**
- **Authentication failures** - Attempted unauthorized access
- **Error spikes** - Unusual system behavior that might indicate attacks
- **Performance degradation** - Could indicate resource-based attacks
- **Database access patterns** - Unusual data access attempts
- **Network connections** - Unexpected traffic patterns
- **Security tool alerts** - Vulnerability scanners and monitoring systems

### **Alert Response Times:**
