# Feature Match AI Implementation Plan

## üìã **Overview**

The Feature Match AI model represents the most sophisticated product selection algorithm in MandiMonitor. It uses Natural Language Processing and feature extraction to understand user intent and match products based on specific technical specifications and requirements mentioned in user queries.

### **Core Concept**
Transform user queries like "gaming monitor 144hz curved" into structured feature requirements and score products based on how well they match these specific criteria, providing highly personalized and intelligent product recommendations.

**‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Success Factor**: This system's effectiveness depends entirely on our ability to handle Amazon's inconsistent product data. We must build robust data normalization and confidence scoring from the ground up.

---

## üéØ **Strategic Goals**

### **Primary Objectives**
- **Intelligent Product Matching**: Select products based on user-specified technical features rather than just popularity or price
- **Enhanced User Experience**: Provide highly relevant results that feel personalized and understand user intent
- **Feature-Based Scoring**: Implement sophisticated scoring algorithm that prioritizes feature relevance over generic metrics
- **Intelligent Choice Architecture**: Transform single-card limitation into smart multi-card experience with meaningful product comparison
- **India-First Design**: Support mixed-language queries (Hinglish), unit variants (inch/cm), and currency assumptions (‚Çπ)
- **Data Quality Over Noise**: Prioritize authoritative fields (specs) over SEO-stuffed titles

### **Success Metrics**
- **Relevance Score**: >85% user satisfaction with feature-matched product selections
- **Feature Detection Accuracy**: >90% correct extraction of technical specifications from queries
- **Performance Impact**: <500ms additional latency for feature analysis
- **Coverage**: Master 1-2 categories initially, then expand to 15+ product categories
- **Locale Support**: Handle Hinglish queries and unit variants (QHD/WQHD/1440p synonyms)
- **Choice Quality**: Multi-card experience shows >20% user selection rate for non-top-1 options
- **Comparison Value**: Users find feature comparison tables helpful (>4.0/5.0 rating)

### **Scope Boundaries (Initial Release)**
- ‚ùå **Not Supported**: Product bundles, renewed items, marketplace sellers (Amazon Retail only)
- ‚ùå **Not Supported**: Products missing core technical specifications
- ‚úÖ **Supported**: Single products with clear technical specs from Amazon Retail

**üìä Analytics Priority**: Build comprehensive measurement infrastructure from Phase 1 to track these ambitious KPIs effectively.

## üèóÔ∏è **Architecture Overview**

### **System Components**
1. **NLP Feature Extractor**: Parses user queries into structured feature requirements (with confidence)
2. **Product Feature Analyzer**: Extracts technical specifications from Amazon product data
3. **Feature Matching Engine**: Scores products based on feature alignment + explainability
4. **Multi-Card Selector**: Intelligent selection of top-N products for user comparison
5. **Comparison Engine**: Generates feature comparison tables and differentiation insights
6. **Category-Specific Vocabularies**: Versioned domain knowledge for different product types
7. **Fallback Mechanisms**: Graceful degradation when feature matching fails
8. **Confidence Pipeline**: Carries confidence scores through entire extraction ‚Üí analysis ‚Üí scoring flow

### **Integration Points**
- **Watch Flow**: Hooks into existing product selection logic in `watch_flow.py`
- **PA-API**: Leverages existing GetItems enrichment for detailed product data
- **Smart Watch Builder**: Extends current selection algorithms with AI scoring
- **Caching**: Integrates with existing cache service for performance optimization

**üîç Pre-Implementation Requirement**: Analyze `BaseProductSelectionModel` in `smart_watch_builder.py` to ensure compatibility with async, feature-rich AI model without major refactoring.

---

## üìö **Dependencies & Risk Analysis**

### **Technical Dependencies**
- **NLP Library**: spaCy or NLTK for text processing
- **Feature Extraction**: Regular expressions and pattern matching
- **Amazon Data Quality**: Relies on consistency of product feature descriptions
- **Existing PA-API**: Must not break current SearchItems/GetItems functionality

### **Integration Risks**
- **üî¥ Data Inconsistency**: Amazon product descriptions vary significantly in quality *(HIGHEST PRIORITY)*
- **üî¥ PA-API Field Drift**: Amazon can silently alter field structure without notice
- **Performance Impact**: NLP processing may slow down watch creation
- **Memory Usage**: spaCy models can be memory-intensive (hard cap: <100MB)
- **API Rate Limits**: Additional GetItems calls for detailed features may hit quotas
- **Cold Start Latency**: spaCy model loading can spike initial response times
- **Scope Creep**: Pressure to add more NLP features beyond core requirements

### **Mitigation Strategies (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**
- **Data Robustness**: Implement confidence scoring and validation ranges for all extracted features
- **Field Precedence**: Prioritize TechnicalInfo/Specifications over noisy titles *(REQUIRED)*
- **Contract Testing**: Daily sanity checks of PA-API field presence using known ASIN set
- **Memory Hard Cap**: <100MB additional memory with alerting when exceeded
- **Pre-warming**: Load NLP models during startup, not on first request
- **Lazy Loading**: Only load NLP models when multiple candidate products exist *(REQUIRED)*
- **Aggressive Caching**: Cache all extracted features to avoid reprocessing *(REQUIRED)*
- **Fallback Logic**: Gracefully degrade to existing selection methods
- **Scope Management**: Strictly limit NLP features to proven use cases

    extractor = FeatureExtractor()
    features = extractor.extract_features("gaming monitor 144hz curved 27 inch")
    assert features["refresh_rate"] == "144hz"
    assert features["size"] == "27 inch"
    assert features["curvature"] == "curved"

def test_extract_features_fallback():
    # Test graceful handling of unclear queries
    features = extractor.extract_features("good monitor")
    assert features == {}  # Should return empty dict, not crash
```

## **Phase 2: Product Feature Analysis (Week 2)**

### **Objectives**
Build capability to extract technical specifications from Amazon product data and create structured feature profiles for products.

### **Tasks**
- [ ] **T2.1**: Analyze PA-API product response structure for feature data
- [ ] **T2.2**: Implement product title parsing for technical specifications
- [ ] **T2.3**: Extract features from product descriptions and bullet points
- [ ] **T2.4**: Create feature normalization logic (e.g., "144Hz" = "144 hz" = "144FPS")
- [ ] **T2.5**: Build confidence scoring for extracted product features *(CRITICAL)*
- [ ] **T2.6**: Implement caching for analyzed product features

### **Implementation Details**

#### **Product Feature Sources**
```python
# PA-API Response Analysis
FEATURE_SOURCES = {
    "title": "ItemInfo.Title.DisplayValue",
    "features": "ItemInfo.Features.DisplayValues[]",
    "description": "ItemInfo.ContentInfo.Description",
    "specifications": "ItemInfo.TechnicalInfo.Specifications"
}
```

#### **Feature Normalization**
```python
class FeatureNormalizer:
    """Standardize feature formats across different products."""
    
    REFRESH_RATE_PATTERNS = [
        r"(\d+)\s*hz",
        r"(\d+)\s*fps", 
        r"(\d+)\s*hertz"
    ]
    
    SIZE_PATTERNS = [
        r"(\d+(?:\.\d+)?)\s*inch",
        r"(\d+(?:\.\d+)?)\s*\"",
        r"(\d+(?:\.\d+)?)\s*in"
    ]
```

### **Best Practices**
- **Data Validation**: Validate extracted features against known ranges (e.g., monitor size 10-65 inches)
- **Confidence Scoring**: Assign confidence levels to extracted features
- **Caching Strategy**: Cache feature analysis to avoid reprocessing identical products
- **Error Recovery**: Handle malformed or missing product data gracefully

### **Definition of Done**
- [ ] Successfully extract features from 90% of gaming monitor products in test dataset
- [ ] Feature normalization handles 10+ different format variations for each feature type
- [ ] Field precedence implemented: TechnicalInfo > Specifications > Features > Title
- [ ] Confidence scoring accurately reflects extraction reliability
- [ ] Golden ASIN set (50+ products) with verified specs for regression testing
- [ ] Feature analysis completes in <200ms per product
- [ ] Integration tests with real PA-API responses pass
- [ ] Contract tests verify PA-API field presence using known ASINs

### **üö¶ Go/No-Go Gate Criteria**

#### **üü¢ Go Criteria**
- [ ] **Golden Set**: ‚â•50 ASINs per pilot category with human-verified specs
- [ ] **Accuracy Standard**: Spec extraction ‚â•90% on golden set (titles don't override bullet/spec tables)
- [ ] **Field Precedence**: Documented and signed: Tech Specs > Bullets > Title
- [ ] **Variation Handling**: Policy decided (parent vs child ASIN) - no 60Hz bullets in 144Hz child
- [ ] **Performance**: Per-item analysis p95 ‚â§200ms on cached PA-API payloads
- [ ] **Caching Strategy**: Documented (TTL + invalidation on PA-API changes)

#### **üî¥ No-Go Criteria**
- [ ] **Cross-variation Leakage**: Found on >2% of tested ASINs
- [ ] **Accuracy Failure**: <90% on any must-have feature (refresh rate, panel size, curvature)
- [ ] **Title Dependency**: Analysis depends primarily on title keywords (high noise risk)

#### **üìã Evidence Required**
- [ ] **Golden-set Scorecard**: Per-feature precision/recall
- [ ] **Adversarial Testing**: 10 ASINs (marketing-heavy, contradictory bullets) with extraction diffs
- [ ] **Precedence Table**: Which field wins when conflicts exist

### **Testing Requirements**
```python
def test_product_feature_analysis():
    analyzer = ProductFeatureAnalyzer()
    # Use real PA-API response format
    product_data = {...}  # Full PA-API response
    features = analyzer.analyze_product_features(product_data)
    
    assert "refresh_rate" in features
    assert features["refresh_rate"]["value"] == "144"
    assert features["refresh_rate"]["confidence"] > 0.8

def test_feature_normalization():
    normalizer = FeatureNormalizer()
    assert normalizer.normalize_refresh_rate("144Hz") == "144"
    assert normalizer.normalize_refresh_rate("144 FPS") == "144"
    assert normalizer.normalize_size("27 inch") == "27"
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Phase 2 Note**: Expect significant iteration due to PA-API data inconsistency. Confidence scoring is the most critical component for intelligent matching decisions.

## **Phase 3: Feature Matching Engine (Week 3)**

### **Objectives**
Implement the core scoring algorithm that matches user requirements against product features and ranks products by relevance.

### **Tasks**
- [ ] **T3.1**: Design feature scoring algorithm with weighted importance
- [ ] **T3.2**: Implement exact match vs partial match scoring
- [ ] **T3.3**: Create category-specific feature importance weights (empirical tuning planned)
- [ ] **T3.4**: Build tie-breaking logic using existing popularity/rating scores *(leverage current assets)*
- [ ] **T3.5**: Implement feature mismatch penalty system
- [ ] **T3.6**: Create comprehensive scoring test suite

### **Implementation Details**

#### **Scoring Algorithm**
```python
class FeatureMatchingEngine:
    """Core engine for scoring products based on feature alignment."""
    
    def score_product(self, user_features: Dict, product_features: Dict, category: str) -> float:
        """Calculate feature match score (0.0 to 1.0)."""
        weights = self.get_category_weights(category)
        score = 0.0
        total_weight = 0.0
        
        for feature_name, user_value in user_features.items():
            if feature_name in product_features:
                feature_score = self.calculate_feature_score(
                    user_value, product_features[feature_name], feature_name
                )
                weight = weights.get(feature_name, 1.0)
                score += feature_score * weight
                total_weight += weight
        
        return score / total_weight if total_weight > 0 else 0.0
```

#### **Feature Importance Weights**
```python
GAMING_MONITOR_WEIGHTS = {
    "refresh_rate": 3.0,     # Critical for gaming
    "resolution": 2.5,       # Very important
    "size": 2.0,            # Important for user preference
    "curvature": 1.5,       # Nice to have
    "panel_type": 1.0,      # Technical preference
    "connectivity": 0.8     # Usually adequate on most
}
```

### **Best Practices**
- **Weighted Scoring**: Different features have different importance for user satisfaction
- **Graceful Degradation**: Handle missing features without failing completely
- **Category Specificity**: Gaming monitors prioritize refresh rate, cameras prioritize megapixels
- **Score Transparency**: Log detailed scoring breakdown for debugging

### **Definition of Done**
- [ ] Scoring algorithm correctly prioritizes products with more matching features
- [ ] Category-specific weights demonstrate measurable improvement in relevance
- [ ] Explainability: Generate short rationale for each selection ("Matched: refresh_rate=144Hz, size=27‚Ä≥")
- [ ] Tolerance windows: Near-matches scored with penalty (requested 144Hz, found 165Hz)
- [ ] Monotonicity tests pass: Adding matching features never decreases score
- [ ] Tie-breaking logic maintains deterministic results (ASIN lexical ‚Üí rating)
- [ ] Edge cases (no features, all features missing) handled gracefully
- [ ] Performance: Score 30 products in <50ms

### **üö¶ Go/No-Go Gate Criteria**

#### **üü¢ Go Criteria**
- [ ] **Scoring Documentation**: Finalized hard filters vs soft preferences with penalty windows
- [ ] **Monotonicity Tests**: Pass - adding matched feature never lowers score
- [ ] **Tie-break Policy**: Deterministic (ASIN, rating count, price band)
- [ ] **Top-3 Suitability**: ‚â•95% on eval set (manual judge: "at least one of top-3 fits request")
- [ ] **Performance**: p95 match time ‚â§50ms for 30-item candidate set
- [ ] **Explainability**: Compact rationale hook exists

#### **üî¥ No-Go Criteria**
- [ ] **Quality Degradation**: Top-1 good but Top-3 contains glaring mismatches (category drift)
- [ ] **Non-determinism**: Scores swing >10% across runs with same input
- [ ] **Scoring Imbalance**: Rare feature overwhelms common sense (obscure spec wins despite absurd price)

#### **üìã Evidence Required**
- [ ] **Top-k Accuracy Table**: k=1/3 with human labels
- [ ] **Rationale Samples**: 20 samples (input ‚Üí chosen product ‚Üí "why") for sanity
- [ ] **Unit Test Results**: Monotonicity and penalty windows verification

### **Testing Requirements**
```python
def test_feature_scoring_prioritization():
    engine = FeatureMatchingEngine()
    user_features = {"refresh_rate": "144", "size": "27"}
    
    # Product A: matches both features
    product_a_features = {"refresh_rate": "144", "size": "27", "resolution": "1440p"}
    score_a = engine.score_product(user_features, product_a_features, "gaming_monitor")
    
    # Product B: matches only one feature
    product_b_features = {"refresh_rate": "60", "size": "27", "resolution": "4k"}
    score_b = engine.score_product(user_features, product_b_features, "gaming_monitor")
    
    assert score_a > score_b

def test_category_specific_weights():
    # Verify gaming monitors weight refresh rate higher than cameras
    gaming_weights = engine.get_category_weights("gaming_monitor")
    camera_weights = engine.get_category_weights("camera")
    assert gaming_weights["refresh_rate"] > camera_weights.get("refresh_rate", 0)
```

## **Phase 4: Smart Watch Builder Integration (Week 4)**

### **Objectives**
Integrate the Feature Match AI into the existing smart watch builder as a new selection model, maintaining backward compatibility.

### **Tasks**
- [ ] **T4.1**: Extend SmartWatchBuilder with FeatureMatchModel
- [ ] **T4.2**: Implement `has_technical_features()` query classifier *(critical for AI triggering)*
- [ ] **T4.3**: Create fallback chain: Feature Match ‚Üí Popularity ‚Üí Random *(100% success rate required)*
- [ ] **T4.4**: Add model performance monitoring and logging
- [ ] **T4.5**: Implement A/B testing framework for model comparison
- [ ] **T4.6**: Update watch flow to use new model selection

### **Implementation Details**

#### **Model Integration**
```python
class FeatureMatchModel(BaseProductSelectionModel):
    """AI-powered product selection based on feature matching."""
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.feature_extractor = FeatureExtractor()
        self.product_analyzer = ProductFeatureAnalyzer()
        self.matching_engine = FeatureMatchingEngine()
    
    async def select_product(self, products: List[Dict], user_query: str, **kwargs) -> Dict:
        """Select best product using feature matching."""
        # Extract user requirements
        user_features = self.feature_extractor.extract_features(user_query)
        
        if not user_features:
            # Fallback to popularity model
            return await PopularityModel().select_product(products, user_query, **kwargs)
        
        # Score all products
        scored_products = []
        for product in products:
            product_features = await self.product_analyzer.analyze_product_features(product)
            score = self.matching_engine.score_product(user_features, product_features, "gaming_monitor")
            scored_products.append((product, score))
        
        # Return highest scoring product
        best_product, best_score = max(scored_products, key=lambda x: x[1])
        
        log.info(f"Feature Match AI selected product with score {best_score:.3f}")
        return best_product
```

#### **Model Selection Logic**
```python
def get_selection_model(user_query: str, product_count: int) -> BaseProductSelectionModel:
    """Determine which model to use based on query complexity and product count."""
    
    # Use Feature Match AI for complex queries with sufficient products
    if product_count >= 5 and has_technical_features(user_query):
        return FeatureMatchModel()
    
    # Use Popularity for simple queries
    elif product_count >= 3:
        return PopularityModel()
    
    # Random selection for small datasets
    else:
        return RandomSelectionModel()
```

### **Best Practices**
- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing models continue working unchanged
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track model selection frequency and user satisfaction
- **Graceful Fallback**: Never fail completely - always have a working selection method
- **A/B Testing**: Compare Feature Match AI against existing models with real users

### **Definition of Done**
- [ ] Feature Match AI integrates seamlessly with existing SmartWatchBuilder
- [ ] Model selection logic chooses appropriate algorithm based on query complexity
- [ ] Fallback mechanisms ensure 100% success rate for product selection
- [ ] Performance monitoring shows model usage statistics
- [ ] Integration tests verify compatibility with existing watch flow

### **üö¶ Go/No-Go Gate Criteria**

#### **üü¢ Go Criteria**
- [ ] **Integration Flag**: Added; three models wired (AI, Popularity, Random)
- [ ] **Telemetry Parity**: Uniform across models (model_name, model_version, vocab_version, latency, product_count)
- [ ] **Selection Thresholds**: Rules documented (min candidates ‚â•5; configurable per category)
- [ ] **Latency Budget**: End-to-end tracked (extract‚Üíanalyze‚Üímatch ‚â§350ms p95)

#### **üî¥ No-Go Criteria**
- [ ] **Telemetry Gaps**: Any model lacks parity (can't compare apples to apples)
- [ ] **Underflow Issues**: Result set underflows frequently without triggering fallback
- [ ] **Performance Failure**: p95 end-to-end exceeds budget by >20% in staging runs

#### **üìã Evidence Required**
- [ ] **Staging Dashboard**: Screenshot comparing AI vs Popularity vs Random (latency + completion)
- [ ] **Configuration Dump**: Thresholds and fallbacks

### **Testing Requirements**
```python
def test_model_integration():
    builder = SmartWatchBuilder()
    products = [...]  # List of gaming monitors
    
    # Should use Feature Match AI for complex query
    result = await builder.select_product(products, "gaming monitor 144hz curved")
    assert isinstance(builder.last_used_model, FeatureMatchModel)
    
    # Should fallback for simple query
    result = await builder.select_product(products, "monitor")

## **Phase 5: Watch Flow Integration (Week 5)**

### **Objectives**
Integrate the new AI model into the main watch creation flow, ensuring seamless user experience and maintaining existing functionality.

### **Tasks**
- [ ] **T5.1**: Update `_finalize_watch` function to use AI model selection
- [ ] **T5.2**: Implement model choice logging for user behavior analysis
- [ ] **T5.3**: Add AI selection confidence indicators to user messages (tied to real scores)
- [ ] **T5.4**: Create model performance metrics collection
- [ ] **T5.5**: Implement simple üëç/üëé feedback capture inline after selections
- [ ] **T5.6**: Add user-controllable AI toggle ("Prefer popular picks" opt-out)
- [ ] **T5.7**: Test complete end-to-end flow with AI model

### **Implementation Details**

#### **Watch Flow Integration**
```python
async def _finalize_watch(update: Update, context: ContextTypes.DEFAULT_TYPE, watch_data: dict) -> None:
    """Enhanced watch finalization with AI model selection."""
    
    # Existing filtering logic remains unchanged
    filtered_products = await apply_filters(search_results, watch_data)
    
    if not filtered_products:
        await send_no_products_message(update, context, watch_data)
        return
    
    # NEW: AI-powered product selection
    selection_model = get_selection_model(
        user_query=watch_data["keywords"],
        product_count=len(filtered_products)
    )
    
    selected_product = await selection_model.select_product(
        products=filtered_products,
        user_query=watch_data["keywords"],
        user_preferences=watch_data
    )
    
    # Log model choice for analytics
    log.info(f"Selected product using {selection_model.__class__.__name__}")
    
    # Enhanced user message with AI confidence
    if isinstance(selection_model, FeatureMatchModel):
        confidence_text = "ü§ñ AI-matched based on your requirements"
    else:
        confidence_text = "üìà Selected based on popularity and ratings"
    
    # Continue with existing watch creation flow
    await create_watch_and_send_confirmation(update, context, selected_product, confidence_text)
```

#### **User Experience Enhancements**
```python
def format_ai_selection_message(product: Dict, model_type: str, confidence: float) -> str:
    """Create user-friendly message explaining AI selection."""
    
    if model_type == "FeatureMatchModel":
        return f"""
üéØ **Smart Match Found!**
I analyzed your requirements and found this product that best matches your needs.

ü§ñ **AI Confidence**: {confidence:.0%}
üí° **Why this product**: Matches your specified features like refresh rate, size, and gaming requirements.
        """
    else:
        return f"""
‚≠ê **Popular Choice**
Selected based on customer ratings and popularity.
        """
```

### **Best Practices**
- **Transparency**: Let users know when AI made the selection
- **Non-Breaking Changes**: Maintain all existing functionality
- **Progressive Enhancement**: AI improves experience but doesn't break basic flow
- **User Feedback**: Collect data on AI selection satisfaction

### **Definition of Done**
- [ ] Complete watch creation flow works with AI model selection
- [ ] User messages clearly indicate when AI made the selection
- [ ] Model performance metrics are collected and logged
- [ ] A/B testing framework is operational
- [ ] End-to-end tests pass for both AI and fallback scenarios

### **üö¶ Go/No-Go Gate Criteria**

#### **üü¢ Go Criteria**
- [ ] **User Toggle**: Visible toggle/wording sets expectations ("AI-matched pick; tap to switch to Popular picks")
- [ ] **Real Confidence**: Shown only when backed by real score (mapped bands; not cosmetic)
- [ ] **Feedback Capture**: Inline feedback wired (üëç/üëé) stored with model_version
- [ ] **Telegram Compliance**: Safe link handling verified (no broken callbacks; buy link shown correctly)

#### **üî¥ No-Go Criteria**
- [ ] **Confidence Divergence**: Copy diverges from actual thresholds (trust loss)
- [ ] **Flow Friction**: Drop-off >baseline by >3% in staging
- [ ] **Link Violations**: Violate channel constraints (callbacks opening external URLs)

#### **üìã Evidence Required**
- [ ] **UX Screenshots**: AI vs Popular copy
- [ ] **A/B Staging Funnel**: Start ‚Üí Selection ‚Üí Watch saved
- [ ] **Feedback Samples**: 20 events with payload (user_id hashed, model_version, verdict)

### **Testing Requirements**
```python
async def test_complete_ai_watch_flow():
    """Test full watch creation with AI model selection."""
    
    # Mock user creating watch for "gaming monitor 144hz curved"
    update = create_mock_update(text="gaming monitor 144hz curved")
    context = create_mock_context()
    
    watch_data = {
        "keywords": "gaming monitor 144hz curved",
        "brand": "samsung",
        "max_price": 50000
    }
    
    # Should complete successfully with AI selection
    await _finalize_watch(update, context, watch_data)
    
    # Verify watch was created
    assert len(mock_database.watches) == 1
    
    # Verify AI model was used
    assert "FeatureMatchModel" in caplog.text
    
    # Verify user received appropriate message
    sent_messages = mock_telegram.get_sent_messages()
    assert "ü§ñ AI-matched" in sent_messages[-1]
```

## **Phase 6: Multi-Card Enhancement & User Choice (Week 6)**

### **Objectives**
Transform the single-card output into an intelligent multi-card carousel with comparison features, giving users choice while maintaining the AI's intelligent ranking.

### **Tasks**
- [ ] **T6.1**: Design multi-card selection logic (top-3 AI-ranked products vs single best)
- [ ] **T6.2**: Implement comparison table generator for key feature differences
- [ ] **T6.3**: Create carousel builder for multiple product cards
- [ ] **T6.4**: Add user preference learning from card selection patterns
- [ ] **T6.5**: Design fallback logic (single card when <3 viable options)
- [ ] **T6.6**: Implement A/B testing framework (single vs multi-card experience)

### **Architecture Decision: Single vs Multi-Card**

#### **Current Architecture (Single Card)**
```python
# Current logic in watch_flow.py line 994
best_match = search_results[0]  # Takes first result
asin = best_match.get("asin")
# Creates single watch + single card
```

#### **Enhanced Architecture (Intelligent Multi-Card)**
```python
class MultiCardSelector:
    """Intelligent selection of top-N products for user comparison."""
    
    async def select_products_for_comparison(
        self, 
        scored_products: List[Tuple[Dict, float]], 
        user_features: Dict,
        max_cards: int = 3
    ) -> Dict:
        """Select optimal number of products for user choice.
        
        Returns:
        -------
            {
                'products': List[Dict],  # Top products with rationale
                'comparison_table': Dict,  # Feature differences
                'selection_reason': str,  # Why these specific products
                'presentation_mode': str  # 'single', 'duo', 'trio'
            }
        """
        # Intelligent selection logic
        if len(scored_products) < 2 or scored_products[0][1] > 0.9:
            return {'presentation_mode': 'single', 'products': [scored_products[0][0]]}
        
        # Score diversity and differentiation
        diverse_products = self._select_diverse_products(scored_products, user_features, max_cards)
        comparison_table = self._generate_comparison_table(diverse_products, user_features)
        
        return {
            'products': diverse_products,
            'comparison_table': comparison_table,
            'selection_reason': self._explain_selection(diverse_products, user_features),
            'presentation_mode': f'{"trio" if len(diverse_products) == 3 else "duo"}'
        }
```

### **Implementation Details**

#### **Intelligent Selection Criteria**
```python
def should_show_multiple_cards(self, scored_products: List, threshold_gap: float = 0.15) -> bool:
    """Determine if multiple cards provide value to user."""
    if len(scored_products) < 2:
        return False
    
    top_score = scored_products[0][1]
    second_score = scored_products[1][1]
    
    # Show multiple cards if:
    # 1. Multiple products are close in score (competitive options)
    # 2. Products have different key features (meaningful choice)
    # 3. Price ranges offer different value propositions
    
    return (
        (top_score - second_score) < threshold_gap or  # Close competition
        self._products_have_different_strengths(scored_products[:3]) or  # Different benefits
        self._price_ranges_offer_value_choice(scored_products[:3])  # Price vs features trade-off
    )
```

#### **Comparison Table Generation**
```python
def _generate_comparison_table(self, products: List[Dict], user_features: Dict) -> Dict:
    """Generate side-by-side feature comparison."""
    comparison = {
        'headers': ['Feature', 'Option 1', 'Option 2', 'Option 3'],
        'key_differences': [],
        'strengths': {},  # Which product excels in what
        'trade_offs': []  # What user gains/loses with each choice
    }
    
    # Extract key differentiating features
    for feature in ['refresh_rate', 'size', 'price', 'brand']:
        if feature in user_features:
            values = [self._get_product_feature_value(p, feature) for p in products]
            if len(set(values)) > 1:  # Only show if products differ
                comparison['key_differences'].append({
                    'feature': feature.replace('_', ' ').title(),
                    'values': values,
                    'user_preference': user_features[feature]
                })
    
    return comparison
```

#### **Carousel Enhancement**
```python
# In bot/carousel.py - extend existing functionality
def build_product_carousel(
    products: List[Dict], 
    comparison_table: Dict, 
    selection_reason: str,
    watch_id: int
) -> List[Dict]:
    """Build carousel of product cards with comparison context."""
    
    cards = []
    for i, product in enumerate(products):
        # Build enhanced card with differentiation highlights
        card = build_single_card(
            title=product['title'],
            price=product['price'],
            image=product['image'],
            asin=product['asin'],
            watch_id=watch_id
        )
        
        # Add AI insights to caption
        strengths = comparison_table['strengths'].get(i, [])
        if strengths:
            card['caption'] += f"\n‚ú® Best for: {', '.join(strengths)}"
        
        cards.append(card)
    
    # Add comparison summary as final message
    comparison_summary = build_comparison_summary(comparison_table, selection_reason)
    cards.append(comparison_summary)
    
    return cards
```

### **User Experience Design**

#### **Multi-Card Flow**
1. **AI Selection**: "ü§ñ Found 3 great options that match your requirements"
2. **Product Cards**: Carousel with individual product cards (existing UI)
3. **Comparison Table**: Feature-by-feature breakdown
4. **Choice Prompt**: "Tap any product to create watch, or /refine to adjust criteria"

#### **Smart Defaults**
- **Single Card**: When AI confidence >90% or <2 viable options
- **Duo Cards**: When 2 products have different strengths (price vs performance)
- **Trio Cards**: When multiple competitive options exist
- **Fallback**: Revert to single card if carousel fails

### **Best Practices**
- **Choice Overload Prevention**: Max 3 cards, clear differentiation
- **AI Transparency**: Explain why these specific products were chosen
- **Graceful Degradation**: Single card fallback maintains existing UX
- **Performance Focus**: Additional cards only when they add genuine value

### **üö¶ Go/No-Go Gate Criteria**

#### **üü¢ Go Criteria**
- [ ] **Selection Logic**: Multi-card only when it provides genuine user value (not always)
- [ ] **Performance**: Carousel generation ‚â§200ms additional latency
- [ ] **UX Testing**: A/B test shows equal or better user satisfaction vs single card
- [ ] **Fallback Reliability**: Single card mode works 100% when multi-card fails
- [ ] **Comparison Quality**: Feature differences are meaningful and accurate

#### **üî¥ No-Go Criteria**
- [ ] **Choice Overload**: Users consistently ignore additional options (selection rate <20%)
- [ ] **Performance Impact**: Carousel adds >300ms latency to watch creation
- [ ] **UX Degradation**: Multi-card experience confuses users or reduces completion rates

#### **üìã Evidence Required**
- [ ] **A/B Test Results**: Single vs multi-card user satisfaction and completion rates
- [ ] **Performance Benchmarks**: Latency impact of carousel generation
- [ ] **User Selection Analytics**: Which cards users choose and why

---

## **Phase 7: Category Expansion & Optimization (Week 7)**

### **Objectives**
Extend AI model to support multiple product categories and optimize performance for production usage.

### **Tasks**
- [ ] **T6.1**: Create feature vocabularies for laptops, headphones, smartphones *(only after gaming monitor success)*
- [ ] **T6.2**: Implement category auto-detection from user queries
- [ ] **T6.3**: Optimize NLP model loading and memory usage *(performance critical)*
- [ ] **T6.4**: Implement feature extraction caching *(paramount for performance)*
- [ ] **T6.5**: Create production monitoring and alerting
- [ ] **T6.6**: Performance testing and optimization

### **Implementation Details**

#### **Multi-Category Support**
```python
CATEGORY_VOCABULARIES = {
    "gaming_monitor": {
        "refresh_rate": ["hz", "fps", "hertz"],
        "size": ["inch", "in", '"'],
        "resolution": ["4k", "1440p", "1080p", "qhd", "uhd"],
        "curvature": ["curved", "flat"],
        "panel_type": ["ips", "va", "tn", "oled"]
    },
    "laptop": {
        "processor": ["intel", "amd", "ryzen", "core i5", "core i7"],
        "ram": ["gb", "ram", "memory"],
        "storage": ["ssd", "hdd", "tb", "gb"],
        "screen_size": ["inch", "in", '"'],
        "graphics": ["rtx", "gtx", "radeon", "gpu"]
    },
    "headphones": {
        "type": ["over-ear", "on-ear", "in-ear", "bluetooth"],
        "noise_cancellation": ["anc", "noise cancelling"],
        "wireless": ["bluetooth", "wireless", "wired"],
        "brand": ["sony", "bose", "sennheiser", "audio-technica"]
    }
}
```

#### **Category Detection**
```python
class CategoryDetector:
    """Automatically detect product category from user query."""
    
    CATEGORY_KEYWORDS = {
        "gaming_monitor": ["monitor", "display", "screen", "gaming"],
        "laptop": ["laptop", "notebook", "computer"],
        "headphones": ["headphones", "earphones", "earbuds"],
        "smartphone": ["phone", "smartphone", "mobile"]
    }
    
    def detect_category(self, query: str) -> str:
        """Detect most likely product category from user query."""
        query_lower = query.lower()
        scores = {}
        
        for category, keywords in self.CATEGORY_KEYWORDS.items():
            score = sum(1 for keyword in keywords if keyword in query_lower)
            if score > 0:
                scores[category] = score
        
        return max(scores, key=scores.get) if scores else "general"
```

### **Best Practices**
- **Performance Optimization**: Lazy load category vocabularies only when needed
- **Memory Management**: Unload unused NLP models after processing
- **Caching Strategy**: Cache feature extractions to reduce repeated processing
- **Monitoring**: Track model performance across different categories

### **Definition of Done**
- [ ] AI model successfully handles 4+ product categories
- [ ] Category detection achieves >90% accuracy on test queries
- [ ] Performance optimization reduces average processing time by 30%
- [ ] Production monitoring dashboard shows real-time model metrics
- [ ] Load testing confirms system can handle 100+ concurrent AI selections

### **üö¶ Go/No-Go Gate Criteria**

#### **üü¢ Go Criteria**
- [ ] **Category Ontology**: Published per-category (aliases, units, hard/soft features)
- [ ] **Per-Category Accuracy**: ‚â•90% on golden sets; no category <85%
- [ ] **Performance Stability**: Holds at target with N categories (memory and p95 stable)
- [ ] **Mixed-Language Support**: Dictionary updated (Hindi/Hinglish synonyms) for new categories

#### **üî¥ No-Go Criteria**
- [ ] **Category Performance**: Any single category <85% or high mismatch complaints
- [ ] **Ontology Drift**: Not versioned (breaking changes leak into prod)

#### **üìã Evidence Required**
- [ ] **Ontology Version**: File + migration notes
- [ ] **Per-Category Scorecard**: Accuracy, latency, complaint rate
- [ ] **Performance Dashboard**: Before/After when enabling category

### **Testing Requirements**
```python
def test_multi_category_support():
    extractor = FeatureExtractor()
    
    # Gaming monitor features
    monitor_features = extractor.extract_features("gaming monitor 144hz", "gaming_monitor")
    assert "refresh_rate" in monitor_features
    
    # Laptop features
    laptop_features = extractor.extract_features("gaming laptop 16gb ram", "laptop")
    assert "ram" in laptop_features
    
    # Headphones features
    headphone_features = extractor.extract_features("wireless noise cancelling headphones", "headphones")
    assert "wireless" in headphone_features

def test_category_detection():
    detector = CategoryDetector()
    assert detector.detect_category("gaming monitor 144hz") == "gaming_monitor"
    assert detector.detect_category("laptop 16gb ram") == "laptop"
    assert detector.detect_category("bluetooth headphones") == "headphones"
```

## üß™ **Testing Strategy**

### **Unit Testing Framework**
```python
# tests/test_ai/test_feature_extractor.py
class TestFeatureExtractor:
    def test_gaming_monitor_feature_extraction(self):
        # Test various query formats
        test_cases = [
            ("gaming monitor 144hz curved 27 inch", {"refresh_rate": "144", "curvature": "curved", "size": "27"}),
            ("27 inch 4k monitor", {"size": "27", "resolution": "4k"}),
            ("curved gaming display 165 fps", {"curvature": "curved", "refresh_rate": "165"})
        ]
        
        extractor = FeatureExtractor()
        for query, expected in test_cases:
            result = extractor.extract_features(query, "gaming_monitor")
            for key, value in expected.items():
                assert result[key] == value

# tests/test_ai/test_integration.py
class TestAIIntegration:
    async def test_end_to_end_ai_selection(self):
        # Test complete flow from query to product selection
        products = await create_test_product_dataset()
        model = FeatureMatchModel()
        
        result = await model.select_product(products, "gaming monitor 144hz curved")
        assert result is not None
        assert "144" in result["title"].lower() or "144" in result.get("features", [])
```

### **Integration Testing**
- **Watch Flow Integration**: Test AI model within complete watch creation process
- **PA-API Compatibility**: Ensure AI doesn't break existing API functionality
- **Performance Testing**: Verify acceptable response times under load
- **Fallback Testing**: Confirm graceful degradation when AI fails

### **Performance Benchmarks**
```python
def test_performance_benchmarks():
    # Feature extraction should be fast
    start_time = time.time()
    features = extractor.extract_features("gaming monitor 144hz curved 27 inch")
    extraction_time = time.time() - start_time
    assert extraction_time < 0.1  # 100ms max
    
    # Product scoring should handle large datasets
    start_time = time.time()
    scores = engine.score_products(user_features, products[:30])
    scoring_time = time.time() - start_time
    assert scoring_time < 0.5  # 500ms max for 30 products
```

**üß™ Testing Priority**: Create high-quality mock PA-API dataset for meaningful tests. Dedicated `tests/test_ai/` module required.

---

## üìä **Monitoring & Analytics**

### **Key Metrics to Track**
- **Model Usage**: Frequency of Feature Match AI vs fallback models
- **User Satisfaction**: Implicit feedback through watch completion rates + explicit üëç/üëé
- **Performance**: Processing time for feature extraction and scoring (p50/p90/p99)
- **Accuracy**: Feature detection confidence scores
- **Coverage**: Percentage of queries that trigger AI model
- **Guardrail Metrics**: Bad outcome rate (watch deleted <5min), reconsider rate (immediate query edit)
- **Quality Metrics**: Top-N suitability (good match in top-3), complaint taxonomy

### **Logging Implementation**
```python
class AIModelAnalytics:
    """Track AI model performance and usage."""
    
    def log_model_selection(self, model_type: str, model_version: str, vocab_version: str, category: str, query_hash: str, product_count: int, latency_ms: float):
        """Log which model was selected and why."""
        log.info(f"AI_ANALYTICS: model={model_type}, model_v={model_version}, vocab_v={vocab_version}, category={category}, products={product_count}, latency_ms={latency_ms:.1f}")
    
    def log_feature_extraction(self, query_hash: str, features: Dict, confidence: float):
        """Log feature extraction results (query hashed for privacy)."""
        log.info(f"AI_FEATURES: query_hash={query_hash}, extracted={list(features.keys())}, confidence={confidence:.3f}")
    
    def log_product_scoring(self, scores: List[float], selected_score: float, rationale: str):
        """Log scoring distribution and selection with explainability."""
        log.info(f"AI_SCORING: avg_score={np.mean(scores):.3f}, selected_score={selected_score:.3f}, rationale='{rationale}'")
```

### **Dashboard Metrics**
- **Daily AI Usage**: Charts showing Feature Match AI vs other models
- **Feature Detection Accuracy**: Confidence score distributions
- **User Behavior**: Watch completion rates by model type
- **Performance Trends**: Processing time over time

**üö® PRE-PHASE-1 REQUIREMENT**: Design concrete log parsing strategy for dashboard generation. This cannot be an afterthought.

---

## üîß **Production Deployment Strategy**

### **Gradual Rollout Plan**
1. **Shadow Launch**: Run AI in background for 1 week (compute scores, don't expose to users)
2. **Phase 6.1**: Deploy with 10% of users (A/B testing, minimum 7 days or N=1,000 watches per arm)
3. **Phase 6.2**: Increase to 25% if metrics show improvement
4. **Phase 6.3**: Full rollout if performance is stable

**Sticky Assignment**: Users remain in their cohort via user_id hash for consistent experience

### **Feature Flags**
```python
# Feature flag implementation
ENABLE_AI_MODEL = os.getenv("ENABLE_AI_MODEL", "false").lower() == "true"
AI_ROLLOUT_PERCENTAGE = int(os.getenv("AI_ROLLOUT_PERCENTAGE", "0"))

def should_use_ai_model(user_id: int) -> bool:
    """Determine if user should get AI model based on rollout percentage."""
    if not ENABLE_AI_MODEL:
        return False
    
    return hash(str(user_id)) % 100 < AI_ROLLOUT_PERCENTAGE
```

### **Rollback Plan**
- **Immediate Rollback**: Disable AI model via feature flag if error rate > 5%
- **Performance Rollback**: Disable if average response time > 2 seconds
- **User Experience Rollback**: Disable if watch completion rate drops > 10%

**üõ°Ô∏è De-Risk Strategy**: Implement and review `should_use_ai_model()` logic before any AI code is merged.

## üéØ **Key Implementation Insights (Integrated from Dual Audit)**

### **Critical Success Factors**
1. **Data Quality Over Everything**: Amazon's data inconsistency is the #1 risk. Field precedence (specs > titles) and confidence scoring are non-negotiable.
2. **India-First Localization**: Support Hinglish queries, unit variants, and cultural preferences from Day 1.
3. **Performance is Core Architecture**: Lazy loading, caching, pre-warming are requirements, not optimizations.
4. **Reliability Through Fallbacks**: 100% success rate via AI ‚Üí Popularity ‚Üí Random chain is mandatory.
5. **Explainable Intelligence**: Users must understand why AI picked a product ("Matched: 144Hz, 27‚Ä≥").
6. **Analytics from Phase 1**: Build measurement infrastructure early, not as an afterthought.

### **Quality Assurance Strategy**
- **Golden ASIN Sets**: 50+ verified products per category for regression testing
- **Contract Testing**: Daily PA-API field presence validation
- **Adversarial Testing**: Marketing fluff, contradictory specs, variation conflicts
- **Performance Monitoring**: p50/p90/p99 latency tracking per component
- **Shadow Deployment**: 1-week background validation before user exposure

### **Localization Requirements**
- **Mixed Language**: "gaming monitor 144hz curved" + Hinglish variants
- **Unit Normalization**: inch/‚Ä≥/cm, Hz/FPS/hertz, QHD/WQHD/1440p synonyms
- **Cultural Adaptation**: Currency (‚Çπ), measurement preferences, brand familiarity

### **Revised Timeline Expectations**
