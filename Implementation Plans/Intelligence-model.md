# Feature Match AI Implementation Plan

## üìã **Overview**

The Feature Match AI model represents the most sophisticated product selection algorithm in MandiMonitor. It uses Natural Language Processing and feature extraction to understand user intent and match products based on specific technical specifications and requirements mentioned in user queries.

### **Core Concept**
Transform user queries like "gaming monitor 144hz curved" into structured feature requirements and score products based on how well they match these specific criteria, providing highly personalized and intelligent product recommendations.

**‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Success Factor**: This system's effectiveness depends entirely on our ability to handle Amazon's inconsistent product data. We must build robust data normalization and confidence scoring from the ground up.

---

## üéØ **Strategic Goals**

### **Primary Objectives**
- **Intelligent Product Matching**: Select products based on user-specified technical features rather than just popularity or price
- **Enhanced User Experience**: Provide highly relevant results that feel personalized and understand user intent
- **Feature-Based Scoring**: Implement sophisticated scoring algorithm that prioritizes feature relevance over generic metrics
- **Intelligent Choice Architecture**: Transform single-card limitation into smart multi-card experience with meaningful product comparison
- **India-First Design**: Support mixed-language queries (Hinglish), unit variants (inch/cm), and currency assumptions (‚Çπ)
- **Data Quality Over Noise**: Prioritize authoritative fields (specs) over SEO-stuffed titles

### **Success Metrics**
- **Relevance Score**: >85% user satisfaction with feature-matched product selections
- **Feature Detection Accuracy**: >90% correct extraction of technical specifications from queries
- **Performance Impact**: <500ms additional latency for feature analysis
- **Coverage**: Master 1-2 categories initially, then expand to 15+ product categories
- **Locale Support**: Handle Hinglish queries and unit variants (QHD/WQHD/1440p synonyms)
- **Choice Quality**: Multi-card experience shows >20% user selection rate for non-top-1 options
- **Comparison Value**: Users find feature comparison tables helpful (>4.0/5.0 rating)

### **Scope Boundaries (Initial Release)**
- ‚ùå **Not Supported**: Product bundles, renewed items, marketplace sellers (Amazon Retail only)
- ‚ùå **Not Supported**: Products missing core technical specifications
- ‚úÖ **Supported**: Single products with clear technical specs from Amazon Retail

**üìä Analytics Priority**: Build comprehensive measurement infrastructure from Phase 1 to track these ambitious KPIs effectively.

## üèóÔ∏è **Architecture Overview**

### **System Components**
1. **NLP Feature Extractor**: Parses user queries into structured feature requirements (with confidence)
2. **Product Feature Analyzer**: Extracts technical specifications from Amazon product data
3. **Feature Matching Engine**: Scores products based on feature alignment + explainability
4. **Multi-Card Selector**: Intelligent selection of top-N products for user comparison
5. **Comparison Engine**: Generates feature comparison tables and differentiation insights
6. **Category-Specific Vocabularies**: Versioned domain knowledge for different product types
7. **Fallback Mechanisms**: Graceful degradation when feature matching fails
8. **Confidence Pipeline**: Carries confidence scores through entire extraction ‚Üí analysis ‚Üí scoring flow

### **Integration Points**
- **Watch Flow**: Hooks into existing product selection logic in `watch_flow.py`
- **PA-API**: Leverages existing GetItems enrichment for detailed product data
- **Smart Watch Builder**: Extends current selection algorithms with AI scoring
- **Caching**: Integrates with existing cache service for performance optimization

**üîç Pre-Implementation Requirement**: Analyze `BaseProductSelectionModel` in `smart_watch_builder.py` to ensure compatibility with async, feature-rich AI model without major refactoring.

---

## üìö **Dependencies & Risk Analysis**

### **Technical Dependencies**
- **NLP Library**: spaCy or NLTK for text processing
- **Feature Extraction**: Regular expressions and pattern matching
- **Amazon Data Quality**: Relies on consistency of product feature descriptions
- **Existing PA-API**: Must not break current SearchItems/GetItems functionality

### **Integration Risks**
- **üî¥ Data Inconsistency**: Amazon product descriptions vary significantly in quality *(HIGHEST PRIORITY)*
- **üî¥ PA-API Field Drift**: Amazon can silently alter field structure without notice
- **Performance Impact**: NLP processing may slow down watch creation
- **Memory Usage**: spaCy models can be memory-intensive (hard cap: <100MB)
- **API Rate Limits**: Additional GetItems calls for detailed features may hit quotas
- **Cold Start Latency**: spaCy model loading can spike initial response times
- **Scope Creep**: Pressure to add more NLP features beyond core requirements

### **Mitigation Strategies (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**
- **Data Robustness**: Implement confidence scoring and validation ranges for all extracted features
- **Field Precedence**: Prioritize TechnicalInfo/Specifications over noisy titles *(REQUIRED)*
- **Contract Testing**: Daily sanity checks of PA-API field presence using known ASIN set
- **Memory Hard Cap**: <100MB additional memory with alerting when exceeded
- **Pre-warming**: Load NLP models during startup, not on first request
- **Lazy Loading**: Only load NLP models when multiple candidate products exist *(REQUIRED)*
- **Aggressive Caching**: Cache all extracted features to avoid reprocessing *(REQUIRED)*
- **Fallback Logic**: Gracefully degrade to existing selection methods
- **Scope Management**: Strictly limit NLP features to proven use cases

- [x] **T3.6**: Create comprehensive scoring test suite *(Completed 26/08/2025)*

### **Implementation Details**

#### **Scoring Algorithm**
```python
class FeatureMatchingEngine:
    """Core engine for scoring products based on feature alignment."""
    
    def score_product(self, user_features: Dict, product_features: Dict, category: str) -> float:
        """Calculate feature match score (0.0 to 1.0)."""
        weights = self.get_category_weights(category)
        score = 0.0
        total_weight = 0.0
        
        for feature_name, user_value in user_features.items():
            if feature_name in product_features:
                feature_score = self.calculate_feature_score(
                    user_value, product_features[feature_name], feature_name
                )
                weight = weights.get(feature_name, 1.0)
                score += feature_score * weight
                total_weight += weight
        
        return score / total_weight if total_weight > 0 else 0.0
```

#### **Feature Importance Weights**
```python
GAMING_MONITOR_WEIGHTS = {
    "refresh_rate": 3.0,     # Critical for gaming
    "resolution": 2.5,       # Very important
    "size": 2.0,            # Important for user preference

### **Original Implementation Details**

#### **Model Integration**
```python
class FeatureMatchModel(BaseProductSelectionModel):
    """AI-powered product selection based on feature matching."""
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.feature_extractor = FeatureExtractor()
        self.product_analyzer = ProductFeatureAnalyzer()
        self.matching_engine = FeatureMatchingEngine()
    
    async def select_product(self, products: List[Dict], user_query: str, **kwargs) -> Dict:
        """Select best product using feature matching."""
        # Extract user requirements
        user_features = self.feature_extractor.extract_features(user_query)
        
        if not user_features:
            # Fallback to popularity model
            return await PopularityModel().select_product(products, user_query, **kwargs)
        
        # Score all products
        scored_products = []
        for product in products:
            product_features = await self.product_analyzer.analyze_product_features(product)
            score = self.matching_engine.score_product(user_features, product_features, "gaming_monitor")
            scored_products.append((product, score))
        
        # Return highest scoring product
        best_product, best_score = max(scored_products, key=lambda x: x[1])
        
        log.info(f"Feature Match AI selected product with score {best_score:.3f}")
        return best_product
```

#### **Model Selection Logic**
```python
def get_selection_model(user_query: str, product_count: int) -> BaseProductSelectionModel:
    """Determine which model to use based on query complexity and product count."""
    
    # Use Feature Match AI for complex queries with sufficient products
    if product_count >= 5 and has_technical_features(user_query):
        return FeatureMatchModel()
    
    # Use Popularity for simple queries
    elif product_count >= 3:
        return PopularityModel()
    
    # Random selection for small datasets
    else:
        return RandomSelectionModel()
```

### **Best Practices**

## **Phase 6: Multi-Card Enhancement & User Choice (Week 6)**

### **Objectives**
Transform the single-card output into an intelligent multi-card carousel with comparison features, giving users choice while maintaining the AI's intelligent ranking.

### **Tasks**
- [ ] **T6.1**: Design multi-card selection logic (top-3 AI-ranked products vs single best)
- [ ] **T6.2**: Implement comparison table generator for key feature differences
- [ ] **T6.3**: Create carousel builder for multiple product cards
- [ ] **T6.4**: Add user preference learning from card selection patterns
- [ ] **T6.5**: Design fallback logic (single card when <3 viable options)
- [ ] **T6.6**: Implement A/B testing framework (single vs multi-card experience)

### **Architecture Decision: Single vs Multi-Card**

#### **Current Architecture (Single Card)**
```python
# Current logic in watch_flow.py line 994
best_match = search_results[0]  # Takes first result
asin = best_match.get("asin")
# Creates single watch + single card
```

#### **Enhanced Architecture (Intelligent Multi-Card)**
```python
class MultiCardSelector:
    """Intelligent selection of top-N products for user comparison."""
    
    async def select_products_for_comparison(
        self, 
        scored_products: List[Tuple[Dict, float]],

            'presentation_mode': f'{"trio" if len(diverse_products) == 3 else "duo"}'
        }
```

### **Implementation Details**

#### **Intelligent Selection Criteria**
```python
def should_show_multiple_cards(self, scored_products: List, threshold_gap: float = 0.15) -> bool:
    """Determine if multiple cards provide value to user."""
    if len(scored_products) < 2:
        return False
    
    top_score = scored_products[0][1]
    second_score = scored_products[1][1]
    
    # Show multiple cards if:
    # 1. Multiple products are close in score (competitive options)
    # 2. Products have different key features (meaningful choice)
    # 3. Price ranges offer different value propositions
    
    return (
        (top_score - second_score) < threshold_gap or  # Close competition
        self._products_have_different_strengths(scored_products[:3]) or  # Different benefits
        self._price_ranges_offer_value_choice(scored_products[:3])  # Price vs features trade-off
    )
```

#### **Comparison Table Generation**
```python
def _generate_comparison_table(self, products: List[Dict], user_features: Dict) -> Dict:
    """Generate side-by-side feature comparison."""
    comparison = {
        'headers': ['Feature', 'Option 1', 'Option 2', 'Option 3'],
        'key_differences': [],
        'strengths': {},  # Which product excels in what
        'trade_offs': []  # What user gains/loses with each choice
    }
    
    # Extract key differentiating features
    for feature in ['refresh_rate', 'size', 'price', 'brand']:
        if feature in user_features:
            values = [self._get_product_feature_value(p, feature) for p in products]
            if len(set(values)) > 1:  # Only show if products differ
                comparison['key_differences'].append({
                    'feature': feature.replace('_', ' ').title(),
                    'values': values,
                    'user_preference': user_features[feature]
                })
    
    return comparison
```

#### **Carousel Enhancement**
```python
# In bot/carousel.py - extend existing functionality
def build_product_carousel(
    products: List[Dict], 
    comparison_table: Dict, 
    selection_reason: str,
    watch_id: int
) -> List[Dict]:
    """Build carousel of product cards with comparison context."""
    
    cards = []
    for i, product in enumerate(products):
        # Build enhanced card with differentiation highlights
        card = build_single_card(
            title=product['title'],
            price=product['price'],
            image=product['image'],
            asin=product['asin'],
            watch_id=watch_id
        )
        
        # Add AI insights to caption
        strengths = comparison_table['strengths'].get(i, [])
        if strengths:
            card['caption'] += f"\n‚ú® Best for: {', '.join(strengths)}"
        
        cards.append(card)
    
    # Add comparison summary as final message
    comparison_summary = build_comparison_summary(comparison_table, selection_reason)
    cards.append(comparison_summary)
    
    return cards
```

### **User Experience Design**

#### **Multi-Card Flow**
1. **AI Selection**: "ü§ñ Found 3 great options that match your requirements"
2. **Product Cards**: Carousel with individual product cards (existing UI)
3. **Comparison Table**: Feature-by-feature breakdown
4. **Choice Prompt**: "Tap any product to create watch, or /refine to adjust criteria"

#### **Smart Defaults**
- **Single Card**: When AI confidence >90% or <2 viable options
- **Duo Cards**: When 2 products have different strengths (price vs performance)
- **Trio Cards**: When multiple competitive options exist
- **Fallback**: Revert to single card if carousel fails

### **Best Practices**
- **Choice Overload Prevention**: Max 3 cards, clear differentiation
- **AI Transparency**: Explain why these specific products were chosen
- **Graceful Degradation**: Single card fallback maintains existing UX
- **Performance Focus**: Additional cards only when they add genuine value

### **üö¶ Go/No-Go Gate Criteria**

#### **üü¢ Go Criteria**
- [ ] **Selection Logic**: Multi-card only when it provides genuine user value (not always)
- [ ] **Performance**: Carousel generation ‚â§200ms additional latency
- [ ] **UX Testing**: A/B test shows equal or better user satisfaction vs single card
- [ ] **Fallback Reliability**: Single card mode works 100% when multi-card fails
- [ ] **Comparison Quality**: Feature differences are meaningful and accurate

## **Phase 7: Category Expansion & Optimization (Week 7)**

### **Objectives**
Extend AI model to support multiple product categories and optimize performance for production usage.

### **Tasks**
- [ ] **T6.1**: Create feature vocabularies for laptops, headphones, smartphones *(only after gaming monitor success)*
- [ ] **T6.2**: Implement category auto-detection from user queries
- [ ] **T6.3**: Optimize NLP model loading and memory usage *(performance critical)*
- [ ] **T6.4**: Implement feature extraction caching *(paramount for performance)*
- [ ] **T6.5**: Create production monitoring and alerting
- [ ] **T6.6**: Performance testing and optimization

### **Implementation Details**

#### **Multi-Category Support**
```python
CATEGORY_VOCABULARIES = {
    "gaming_monitor": {
        "refresh_rate": ["hz", "fps", "hertz"],
        "size": ["inch", "in", '"'],
        "resolution": ["4k", "1440p", "1080p", "qhd", "uhd"],
        "curvature": ["curved", "flat"],
        "panel_type": ["ips", "va", "tn", "oled"]
    },
    "laptop": {
        "processor": ["intel", "amd", "ryzen", "core i5", "core i7"],
        "ram": ["gb", "ram", "memory"],
        "storage": ["ssd", "hdd", "tb", "gb"],
        "screen_size": ["inch", "in", '"'],
        "graphics": ["rtx", "gtx", "radeon", "gpu"]
    },
    "headphones": {
        "type": ["over-ear", "on-ear", "in-ear", "bluetooth"],
        "noise_cancellation": ["anc", "noise cancelling"],
        "wireless": ["bluetooth", "wireless", "wired"],
        "brand": ["sony", "bose", "sennheiser", "audio-technica"]
    }
}
```

#### **Category Detection**
```python
class CategoryDetector:
    """Automatically detect product category from user query."""
    
    CATEGORY_KEYWORDS = {
        "gaming_monitor": ["monitor", "display", "screen", "gaming"],
        "laptop": ["laptop", "notebook", "computer"],
        "headphones": ["headphones", "earphones", "earbuds"],
        "smartphone": ["phone", "smartphone", "mobile"]
    }
    
    def detect_category(self, query: str) -> str:
        """Detect most likely product category from user query."""
        query_lower = query.lower()
        scores = {}
        
        for category, keywords in self.CATEGORY_KEYWORDS.items():
            score = sum(1 for keyword in keywords if keyword in query_lower)
            if score > 0:
                scores[category] = score
        
        return max(scores, key=scores.get) if scores else "general"
```

### **Best Practices**
- **Performance Optimization**: Lazy load category vocabularies only when needed
- **Memory Management**: Unload unused NLP models after processing
- **Caching Strategy**: Cache feature extractions to reduce repeated processing
- **Monitoring**: Track model performance across different categories

### **Definition of Done**
- [ ] AI model successfully handles 4+ product categories
- [ ] Category detection achieves >90% accuracy on test queries
- [ ] Performance optimization reduces average processing time by 30%
- [ ] Production monitoring dashboard shows real-time model metrics
- [ ] Load testing confirms system can handle 100+ concurrent AI selections

### **üö¶ Go/No-Go Gate Criteria**

#### **üü¢ Go Criteria**
- [ ] **Category Ontology**: Published per-category (aliases, units, hard/soft features)
- [ ] **Per-Category Accuracy**: ‚â•90% on golden sets; no category <85%
- [ ] **Performance Stability**: Holds at target with N categories (memory and p95 stable)
- [ ] **Mixed-Language Support**: Dictionary updated (Hindi/Hinglish synonyms) for new categories

#### **üî¥ No-Go Criteria**
- [ ] **Category Performance**: Any single category <85% or high mismatch complaints
- [ ] **Ontology Drift**: Not versioned (breaking changes leak into prod)

#### **üìã Evidence Required**
- [ ] **Ontology Version**: File + migration notes
- [ ] **Per-Category Scorecard**: Accuracy, latency, complaint rate
- [ ] **Performance Dashboard**: Before/After when enabling category

### **Testing Requirements**
```python
def test_multi_category_support():
    extractor = FeatureExtractor()
    
    # Gaming monitor features
    monitor_features = extractor.extract_features("gaming monitor 144hz", "gaming_monitor")
    assert "refresh_rate" in monitor_features
    
    # Laptop features
    laptop_features = extractor.extract_features("gaming laptop 16gb ram", "laptop")
    assert "ram" in laptop_features
    
    # Headphones features
    headphone_features = extractor.extract_features("wireless noise cancelling headphones", "headphones")
    assert "wireless" in headphone_features

def test_category_detection():
    detector = CategoryDetector()
    assert detector.detect_category("gaming monitor 144hz") == "gaming_monitor"
    assert detector.detect_category("laptop 16gb ram") == "laptop"
    assert detector.detect_category("bluetooth headphones") == "headphones"
```

## üß™ **Testing Strategy**

### **Unit Testing Framework**
```python
# tests/test_ai/test_feature_extractor.py
class TestFeatureExtractor:
    def test_gaming_monitor_feature_extraction(self):
        # Test various query formats
        test_cases = [
            ("gaming monitor 144hz curved 27 inch", {"refresh_rate": "144", "curvature": "curved", "size": "27"}),
            ("27 inch 4k monitor", {"size": "27", "resolution": "4k"}),
            ("curved gaming display 165 fps", {"curvature": "curved", "refresh_rate": "165"})
        ]
        
        extractor = FeatureExtractor()
        for query, expected in test_cases:
            result = extractor.extract_features(query, "gaming_monitor")
            for key, value in expected.items():
                assert result[key] == value

# tests/test_ai/test_integration.py
class TestAIIntegration:
    async def test_end_to_end_ai_selection(self):
        # Test complete flow from query to product selection
        products = await create_test_product_dataset()
        model = FeatureMatchModel()
        
        result = await model.select_product(products, "gaming monitor 144hz curved")
        assert result is not None
        assert "144" in result["title"].lower() or "144" in result.get("features", [])
```

### **Integration Testing**
- **Watch Flow Integration**: Test AI model within complete watch creation process
- **PA-API Compatibility**: Ensure AI doesn't break existing API functionality
- **Performance Testing**: Verify acceptable response times under load
- **Fallback Testing**: Confirm graceful degradation when AI fails

### **Performance Benchmarks**
```python
def test_performance_benchmarks():
    # Feature extraction should be fast
    start_time = time.time()
    features = extractor.extract_features("gaming monitor 144hz curved 27 inch")
    extraction_time = time.time() - start_time
    assert extraction_time < 0.1  # 100ms max
    
    # Product scoring should handle large datasets
    start_time = time.time()
    scores = engine.score_products(user_features, products[:30])
    scoring_time = time.time() - start_time
    assert scoring_time < 0.5  # 500ms max for 30 products
```

**üß™ Testing Priority**: Create high-quality mock PA-API dataset for meaningful tests. Dedicated `tests/test_ai/` module required.

---

## üìä **Monitoring & Analytics**

### **Key Metrics to Track**
- **Model Usage**: Frequency of Feature Match AI vs fallback models
- **User Satisfaction**: Implicit feedback through watch completion rates + explicit üëç/üëé
- **Performance**: Processing time for feature extraction and scoring (p50/p90/p99)
- **Accuracy**: Feature detection confidence scores
- **Coverage**: Percentage of queries that trigger AI model
- **Guardrail Metrics**: Bad outcome rate (watch deleted <5min), reconsider rate (immediate query edit)
- **Quality Metrics**: Top-N suitability (good match in top-3), complaint taxonomy

### **Logging Implementation**
```python
class AIModelAnalytics:
    """Track AI model performance and usage."""
    
    def log_model_selection(self, model_type: str, model_version: str, vocab_version: str, category: str, query_hash: str, product_count: int, latency_ms: float):
        """Log which model was selected and why."""
        log.info(f"AI_ANALYTICS: model={model_type}, model_v={model_version}, vocab_v={vocab_version}, category={category}, products={product_count}, latency_ms={latency_ms:.1f}")
    
    def log_feature_extraction(self, query_hash: str, features: Dict, confidence: float):
        """Log feature extraction results (query hashed for privacy)."""
        log.info(f"AI_FEATURES: query_hash={query_hash}, extracted={list(features.keys())}, confidence={confidence:.3f}")
    
    def log_product_scoring(self, scores: List[float], selected_score: float, rationale: str):
        """Log scoring distribution and selection with explainability."""
        log.info(f"AI_SCORING: avg_score={np.mean(scores):.3f}, selected_score={selected_score:.3f}, rationale='{rationale}'")
```

### **Dashboard Metrics**
- **Daily AI Usage**: Charts showing Feature Match AI vs other models
- **Feature Detection Accuracy**: Confidence score distributions
- **User Behavior**: Watch completion rates by model type
- **Performance Trends**: Processing time over time

**üö® PRE-PHASE-1 REQUIREMENT**: Design concrete log parsing strategy for dashboard generation. This cannot be an afterthought.

---

## üîß **Production Deployment Strategy**

### **Gradual Rollout Plan**
1. **Shadow Launch**: Run AI in background for 1 week (compute scores, don't expose to users)
2. **Phase 6.1**: Deploy with 10% of users (A/B testing, minimum 7 days or N=1,000 watches per arm)
3. **Phase 6.2**: Increase to 25% if metrics show improvement
4. **Phase 6.3**: Full rollout if performance is stable

**Sticky Assignment**: Users remain in their cohort via user_id hash for consistent experience

### **Feature Flags**
```python
# Feature flag implementation
ENABLE_AI_MODEL = os.getenv("ENABLE_AI_MODEL", "false").lower() == "true"
AI_ROLLOUT_PERCENTAGE = int(os.getenv("AI_ROLLOUT_PERCENTAGE", "0"))

def should_use_ai_model(user_id: int) -> bool:
    """Determine if user should get AI model based on rollout percentage."""
    if not ENABLE_AI_MODEL:
        return False
    
    return hash(str(user_id)) % 100 < AI_ROLLOUT_PERCENTAGE
```

### **Rollback Plan**
- **Immediate Rollback**: Disable AI model via feature flag if error rate > 5%
- **Performance Rollback**: Disable if average response time > 2 seconds
- **User Experience Rollback**: Disable if watch completion rate drops > 10%

**üõ°Ô∏è De-Risk Strategy**: Implement and review `should_use_ai_model()` logic before any AI code is merged.
