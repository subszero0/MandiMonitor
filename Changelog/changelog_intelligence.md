## 🎯 Next Phase: Phase 6 - Multi-Card Enhancement & User Choice

### 📋 What's Remaining for Phase 6

The next team member should focus on **Phase 6: Multi-Card Enhancement** which involves:

#### **1. Multi-Card Selection Logic** (T6.1)
- **Goal**: Transform single-card output into intelligent multi-card carousel with comparison features
- **Focus Areas**: 
  - Top-3 AI-ranked products vs single best selection
  - Exact match vs partial match scoring logic
  - Category-specific feature importance weights
- **Key Files**: `bot/ai/matching_engine.py` (preview exists, needs completion)

#### **2. Tie-Breaking Logic** (Tasks T3.3-T3.4)
- **Location**: Extend `FeatureMatchingEngine.score_product()`
- **Purpose**: Use existing popularity/rating scores when AI scores are close
- **Integration**: Leverage existing asset scoring from current watch builder

#### **3. Feature Mismatch Penalty System** (Critical - Task T3.5)
```python
# Implement tolerance windows:
# - Exact match: score = 1.0
# - Near match (144Hz requested, 165Hz found): score = 0.9
# - Mismatch penalty: score = 0.0
```

#### **4. Explainability and Monotonicity** (Task T3.6)
- **Purpose**: Generate short rationale for each AI selection
- **Logic**: "Matched: refresh_rate=144Hz, size=27″, curvature=curved"
- **Testing**: Ensure adding matching features never decreases score

### 🔧 Implementation Guidance

#### **Starting Point**
1. **Review Phase 2 Implementation**: Study `bot/ai/product_analyzer.py` for feature extraction patterns
2. **Build on Existing AI Module**: Extend `bot/ai/matching_engine.py` (preview exists)
3. **Integration Points**: Connect FeatureExtractor + ProductFeatureAnalyzer → FeatureMatchingEngine

#### **Key Integration Points**
- **User Features**: Available from `FeatureExtractor.extract_features(query)`
- **Product Features**: Available from `ProductFeatureAnalyzer.analyze_product_features(product)`
- **Scoring Logic**: Build weighted scoring algorithm using confidence from both sources
- **Testing**: Add to `tests/test_ai/` following established patterns from Phase 1&2

#### **Critical Success Factors**
1. **Weighted Scoring**: Refresh rate most important for gaming (3.0x), size personal preference (2.0x)
2. **Tolerance Windows**: Near-matches should score high (144Hz requested, 165Hz found = 0.9 score)
3. **Explainability**: Generate rationale for every selection decision
4. **Monotonicity**: Adding matching features must never decrease score

### ⚠️ Known Challenges for Phase 3

1. **Feature Weight Tuning**: Optimal weights may vary by user preferences and use cases
2. **Tolerance Window Calibration**: Defining "near match" thresholds for different feature types
3. **Tie-Breaking Complexity**: Balancing AI scores with popularity/rating scores
4. **Performance Impact**: Scoring algorithms must maintain <50ms budget for 30 products
