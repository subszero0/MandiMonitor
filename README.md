## üöÄ Deployment

### Production Stack
```bash
# Deploy with all services
docker compose up -d
```

The stack includes:
- **Bot Service**: Main application on port 8000
- **Cloudflared**: Secure tunnel for external access
- **Cron Service**: Automated nightly database backups

### GitHub Secrets Required
For automated CI/CD deployment, configure these GitHub repository secrets:

```env
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=
AWS_REGION=us-east-1
ECR_REPOSITORY=mandi-monitor-bot
LIGHTSAIL_HOST=your-server.com
LIGHTSAIL_USER=ubuntu
# Example format - replace with your actual SSH private key
LIGHTSAIL_KEY=-----BEGIN_OPENSSH_PRIVATE_KEY-----
```

### Environment Variables
Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your tokens and settings
```

## üîß Operations

### Backup & Restore

The MandiMonitor bot includes automated encrypted database backups for data protection.

#### Creating Manual Backups

```bash
# Set the backup passphrase (32+ character random string recommended)
export DB_BACKUP_PASSPHRASE="your-secure-passphrase-here"

# Run the backup script
./scripts/backup_db.sh
```

This creates an encrypted backup file in the format: `backups/db_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.sql.gz.gpg`

#### Restoring from Backup

```bash
# Restore from an encrypted backup
gpg --decrypt backups/db_20250728_010000.sql.gz.gpg | gunzip > dealbot.db

# Alternatively, specify the passphrase in the command
echo "your-passphrase" | gpg --batch --passphrase-fd 0 --decrypt backups/db_20250728_010000.sql.gz.gpg | gunzip > dealbot.db
```

#### Automated Nightly Backups

Automated backups run nightly at 1:00 AM IST via GitHub Actions. The workflow:

1. SSHs into the Lightsail instance
2. Creates an encrypted backup using GPG symmetric encryption (AES-256)
3. Uploads the backup to the configured S3 bucket
4. Cleans up backups older than 30 days

**Required GitHub Secrets:**
- `DB_BACKUP_PASSPHRASE`: Encryption passphrase for backups
- `LIGHTSAIL_PRIVATE_KEY`: SSH private key for server access
- `LIGHTSAIL_HOST`: Server hostname/IP
- `BACKUP_BUCKET`: S3 bucket name for backup storage

#### Passphrase Rotation

For security, rotate the backup passphrase quarterly:

1. Generate a new 32+ character random passphrase
2. Update the `DB_BACKUP_PASSPHRASE` secret in GitHub and Lightsail
3. Test the new passphrase with a manual backup
4. Document the rotation date in your security logs

### Infrastructure Hardening

#### Rootless Docker Deployment

MandiMonitor runs with enterprise-grade container security:

```bash
# Deploy with rootless Docker (automatically configured in CI/CD)
./scripts/setup_rootless_docker.sh

# Verify rootless deployment
docker exec $(docker compose ps -q bot) id -u  # Should return 1000, not 0
```

#### Firewall Configuration

The system uses defense-in-depth network security:

```bash
# UFW firewall status (Lightsail instance)
sudo ufw status verbose
# Should show: 22/tcp (SSH) and 443/tcp (Cloudflare) only

# iptables outbound restrictions
sudo iptables -L OUTPUT -n
# Should show: HTTPS (443), DNS (53), NTP (123) allowed, others rejected
```

#### Security Testing

Automated security validation runs in CI/CD:

```bash
# Manual firewall smoke test (creates ephemeral Lightsail instance)
gh workflow run ssh-smoke.yml

# Container security integration tests
pytest tests/integration/test_compose_secure.py -v

# Cloudflare Tunnel ACL tests (requires configuration)
pytest tests/integration/test_tunnel_acl.py -v -m network
```
